# Workshop Exercises

## Setting the scene
You're at your favourite research conference: here to catch up on the latest advances in your field. 
In your own work, you recently finished collecting some data, and mentioned this to a Professor you admire over coffee between talks.
In your excitement, you accidentally offered to send them over one of your data visualisations to include in their key note talk.

Their talk is in 30 minutes!!

## The Data

[//]: # (TODO: Description of the data - how to load it will be on exercise pages)

## The Audience

Luckily, you know exactly the sort of thing that the professor is looking for.
