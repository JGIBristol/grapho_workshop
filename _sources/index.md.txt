# Visualising your Visualisations workshop

## The Workshop
This is a **1-hour workshop** to support research into the decisions we make when we visualise data.

In the workshop, we will:
- Tell you about the  [What Aren't You Seeing?](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ways-what-arent-you-seeing) (WAYS) research project.
- Help you to get up and running with the [Grapho](https://github.com/jamestripp/grapho) package, which will record code and image histories during a data visualisation challenge.
- Give you a short data visualisation challenge
- Show you how to visualise your visualisations
