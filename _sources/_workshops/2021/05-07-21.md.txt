This is a **1-hour workshop** which will help you visualise how you make visualisations, and will support data visualisation research.

In the workshop, we will:

- Help you to get up and running with the [Grapho](https://github.com/jamestripp/grapho) package, which will record code and image histories during a data visualisation challenge.
- Give you a short data visualisation challenge
- Show you how to visualise your visualisations
